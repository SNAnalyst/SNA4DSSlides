# Complex systems

We are surrounded by systems that are hopelessly complicated.

Consider, for example,

- **communications infrastructures** that integrate billions of cell phones
with computers and satellites;

--

- our ability to reason and comprehend our world
requires the coherent activity of billions of **neurons** in our brain;

--

- our biological existence is rooted in seamless interactions
between thousands of **genes and metabolites within our cells**;

--

- **markets** that revolve around thousands of organizations doing business
with each other;

--

- **soccer matches** are characterized by 22 actors constantly moving and
interacting (passing, giving directions, giving support/criticism) in
time and space.

--
  
`r chevron_right()` These systems are collectively called .hl-orange[complex systems] and can
(partly/largely) be understood as **networks**.


---

<br><br>
The various networks we meet in nature or society vary widely:
  
- the nodes of the **metabolic network** are tiny molecules
and the links are chemical reactions
governed by the laws of chemistry and quantum mechanics;
- the nodes of the **WWW** are web documents and the links are URLs
guaranteed by computer algorithms;
- the nodes of **social networks** are individuals or groups of individuals,
and the links represent family, professional, friendship,
and acquaintance ties.

---

<br><br>
The processes that generated these networks also differ
greatly:
  
- **metabolic** networks were shaped by billions of years
of evolution;
- the **WWW** is built on the collective actions of
millions of individuals and organizations;
- **social networks** are
shaped by social norms whose roots go back thousands of
years.

---


# However

a key discovery of network science is that the ***architectures*** of
networks emerging in such varying domains are surprisingly similar to each other,
and are governed by ***similar organizing principles***.

# Formal notation

The most common model of a network in network analysis is that of a _graph_. We
will use these terms interchangeably.

A graph consists of
+ nodes / actors / vertices
+ links / ties / edges / relationships / connections

Formally: $Graph = \{Vertices, Edges\}$

# Each week

<br>

`r chevron_right()` Labs (mostly on Tuesdays) are online (Zoom)
 
`r chevron_right()` Lectures (mostly on Wednesdays) are in the attic

`r chevron_right()` Project progress meetings are at JADS

<br><br><br>

--

- read the book chapter (or other readings) listed on canvas for that week

- do the tutorial on the `snaverse`

- do the *homeplay*

- Come prepared! It will make your life easier and you'll learn so much more :)

---
class: course-logo

# Assessment

- Group project (write a report) - 40%
- Exam - 60%

<br>

## Exam

- Questions and problem sets (with real datasets)

- Similar to the Bootcamp Exam<br>
(but you'll need the full three hours)

---
class: course-logo

# Project (1)

With your group, pick a topic related to one of these application fields:
- Political science
- Organizations
- Internet
- Social influence
- Marketing
- Sport
- Text analysis
- Recommender systems
- Crime & Safety
- other (discuss it with Roger or Gergő)

---
class: course-logo


# Project (2)

- Identify or collect appropriate and relevant data 
- Formulate network-based research questions that can be answered with that data
- Formulate appropriate hypotheses
- Run analyses using the models we will learn in class
- Write a report (about 4500 words)

Details will soon be posted on Canvas, including the intermediate deadlines for the various project milestones.

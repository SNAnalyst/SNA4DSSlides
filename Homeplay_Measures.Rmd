# Blogosphere

Let's look at the blogosphere data we have now seen a few times. 
You haven't actually touched the data, so we are going to do that now.

1. Load the `blogosphere` network from the `SNA4DSData` package.

1. Clean it up a bit: there are some blogs that refer to themselves ("loops"). 
That is not what we want, so remove these loops. 
Also, there are "multiple edges" between the blogs. Remove those as well. 

How do I do that, you ask? 
Well, search through the documentation for `igraph`. 
Alternatively, see if you can find the solution in the course cheatsheet. 
From here on, continue with this cleaned graph.


```{r simplify}
blog1 <- igraph::simplify(blogosphere)
```


1. Calculate summary statistics for this network. 
At least determine:
  - mean distance
  - diameter
  - dyad census
  - reciprocity
  - transitivity
  - density
  
Interpret these numbers, do you understand what they mean? 
Are they what you would expect?


```{r eda}
# mean distance
snafun::g_mean_distance(blog1)
# diameter
snafun::g_diameter(blog1)

# dyad census
snafun::count_dyads(blog1)

# reciprocity
snafun::g_reciprocity(blog1)

# transitivity
snafun::g_transitivity(blog1)

# density
snafun::g_density(blog1)
```

# Communities

I already told you that the network is quite polarized: republican 
blogs see to refer mainly to other republican blogs, and the same 
holds for democratic blogs. So, you would expect some clear subgroups 
in this network. 

1. Use the walktrap algorithm to determine communities in the 
blogosphere network. How many communities do you get? Does the 
partitioning make sense? What do you notice about the result?
(hint: use the cheatsheet to see how you can combine `snafun` and `igraph` here)


```{r blog1}
walk <- snafun::extract_comm_walktrap(blog1)
igraph::membership(walk) |> table()
# igraph::sizes(walk)
igraph::modularity(walk)
igraph::sizes(walk) |> length()
```

1. One thing that might affect the result is that a bunch of the blogs do not point to another blog and no other blog points to them. In SNA we call these nodes *isolates*. 

1. What do you think would happen to the results if you would remove those isolates first? First, think about this. Then actually remove the isolates from the graph and run the walktrap again. Check if you were correct.

```{r blog0}
blog0 <- snafun::remove_isolates(blog1)
walk0 <- snafun::extract_comm_walktrap(blog0)
igraph::membership(walk0) |> table()
igraph::modularity(walk0)
igraph::sizes(walk0) |> length()
```

# Bonus
Continue with this smaller network. You should have 1224 vertices left and 19022 edges between them.

1. Add the group membership (which you get with `igraph::membership`) to the network as a vertex attribute. Call this new vertex attribute `community`.

1. Run the following function: `snafun::make_mixingmatrix(graph_without_isolates, "community")` and check the help documentation of `snafun::make_mixingmatrix` to interpret the result. Does it make sense? What does this tell you about the boundaries around the communities? (obviously, replace `graph_without_isolates` with the actual object name you are using).

1. Extract all of the vertex attributes using `snafun::extract_all_vertex_attributes` and explore whether it is indeed the case that like-minded blogs tend cluster together inside the communities you found. (hint: the simplest approach is to use a table)

```{r blog0_bonus}
blog0 <- snafun::add_vertex_attributes(blog0, "community", value = igraph::membership(walk0))
# alternatively
# igraph::V(blog0)$community <- igraph::membership(walk0)

snafun::make_mixingmatrix(blog0, "community")

all_attr <- snafun::extract_all_vertex_attributes(blog0)

table(all_attr$party, all_attr$community)

value_split <- split(all_attr$value, f = all_attr$community)
data.frame(prop = sapply(value_split, mean), length = sapply(value_split, length))
```

Overall, you shouldn't be surprised about the strong political
divide in the USA at the moment. This was already apparent in the 2004 elections... You just showed that yourself!

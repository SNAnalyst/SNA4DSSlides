# Lecture ERGM 1
<br>
- ERGMs are models for causal inference - if you do not have Hypotheses to test they make no sense

- Inferential network analysis test Hypotheses about why an observed network is the way it is.

- Two types of effects:
    
    - Endogenous: structural - terms that predict the probability of observing a certain network structure
    
    - Exogenous: as in GLM - variables external to the network that predict the occurrence of ties
    
- ERGM with edges term (Erdos Renyi model)
- ERGM with edges + sender + receiver + mutual terms (P1 model)
- ERGM concepts and math

# Data set: Florentine Families

### 16 Families - each node is a family that lived in Florence in the 15th century
Acciaiuoli - Albizzi - Barbadori - Bischeri - Castellani - Ginori - Guadagni - Lamberteschi - Medici - Pazzi - Peruzzi - Pucci - Ridolfi - Salviati - Strozzi - Tornabuoni


### Data collected by historian John Padgett. 

###Two networks: 1) business 2) marriage


Attributes: 
- Wealth (v/n): how reach
- Number Priorates (v/n): How many times a member of their family was Prior of Florence between 1282 and 1344
- Weight (e/n): number of times two families do business/marry to each other

# ERGM with edges term (Erdos Renyi)

## Florentine Marriage 
- 16 nodes - 20 edges - UNDIRECTED
- We observe a marriage pattern (certain network structure). Is it random?
- RQ: Do these Florentine families get married in a random way? .red[Is love blind?]
- H1: Love is not blind in Renaissance Florence



.center[![:scale 29%](assets/images/Flo-marriage.png)]



---

## RQ: Is love blind in Renaissance Florence? 

## H: Love is not blind in Renaissance Florence

```{r lecERGM201, echo=FALSE}

floIgraph <-SNA4DSData::florentine

floIm <- floIgraph$flomarriage

flomarriage <- intergraph::asNetwork(floIm)


```


```{r lecERGM202, echo=TRUE}

flomodel.01 <- ergm::ergm(flomarriage ~ edges)
summary(flomodel.01)

```

## Love has very good sight (The p-value is significant)

### negative coefficient in this case means that the network is sparse. 

---
# ERGM with the edge term (ER)

<br>
 
### Very simple model 

### We can use it to see whether the edges are random or if they exist for a reason

### You will insert the `edge` term in every model -always important

## We use it as the intercept of the model - still it has a meaning

### This will be the first term in every model you run

## Holland and Leinhardt analyzed Sampsonâ€™s monks dataset 

- Ethnographic study of community structure in a New England monastery by Samuel F. Sampson 1968.
- Social relationships among a group of men (novices) who were preparing to join a monastic order.
- Simplified data set - 18 nodes - 88 edges - DIRECTED

## Holland and Leinhardt analyzed Sampsonâ€™s monks dataset (P1 model)
<br>
## .red[RQ: Are the social relationships between these monks random or driven by specific social dynamics?]
## .red[H1: Monks are not friends with everyone (friendship between monks is not random) ]

looking at
- Probability of forming edges (ER model: edges are not random)
- probability of a monk wanting to be friends with another monk (sender)
- Probability that the other monks want to be friends with the first one  (receiver)
- Probability that the two monks mutually want to be each other's friends (mutual)


---
## Hypothesis testing on Sampson data with P1 formulation 

- NB: multiple terms for one hypothesis 
- Look at p-values to see whether we can discard the null Hypothesis
- Look at the coefficient to appraise the intensity of the effect
- Relate results of sender and receiver to the focal node only (!!!) 

```{r lecERGM203, echo=FALSE}

SampsonIgraphtot <- SNA4DSData::Sampson

SampsonLike1Ig <-SampsonIgraphtot$Sampson_like1

sampson <- intergraph::asNetwork(SampsonLike1Ig)

```

```{r lecERGM204, echo=TRUE}

p1 <- ergm::ergm(sampson ~ edges + sender + receiver + mutual) 

summary(p1)
```
]

---
# Individuals  VS network structure
<br>
## Sender and Receiver provide you with results about each node other than the focal one

## .red[They are an exception!]

## .center[most terms inform us about the network overall]

## .center[statistical models are  mostly about collective behavior]

## .center[rather than individual behavior]

### `ergm::search.ergmTerms(keyword, net, categories, name)`

### Arguments

.red[search]: optional character search term to search for in the text of the term descriptions. Only matching terms will be returned. Matching is case insensitive.

.red[net]: a network object that the term would be applied to, used as template to determine directedness, bipartite, etc

.red[keywords]: optional character vector of keyword tags to use to restrict the results (i.e. 'curved', 'triad-related')

.red[name]: optional character name of a specific term to return

.red[packages]: optional character vector indicating the subset of packages in which to search

description: Fitting ERGMs with exogenous terms
# Fitting an ergm with exo terms 

## So far, we only explored endogenous terms. Let's explore exogenous

- something that comes from the outside of the network structure

Wealth of the Florentine families.

Exogenous covariates make the ERG model equivalent to logistic regressions. no simulation (MCMC)

# One Exogenous Dyadic independent term

<br>

### Q: Are rich people more likely to get married?

### H1: The richer a family is, the more likely its members are to marry into other families 

### TERM: `nodecov()` Probability of a tie given the receiver having the similar attribute. 

<br>

```{r lecERGM205, echo=TRUE}

flo.wealth <- ergm::ergm(flomarriage ~ edges + nodecov("Wealth"))

```

---
# Results

- `edges` is (like) the intercept
- `nodecov("Wealth")` is like any other numeric variable in a Logistic regression
 

```{r lecERGM206, echo=TRUE}
summary(flo.wealth)
```

---
# Other option
<br>
## Likelihood to marry in general or to marry whom?

<br>
## RQ: Do families of equal wealth seek marital alliances with one another?
## H1: Families of equal wealth tend to form marital alliances with one another.
<br>

### TERM: `absdiff` - Probability of a tie given the similarity between sender and receiver. 

```{r lecERGM207, echo=TRUE}
flo.wealth1 <- ergm::ergm(flomarriage ~ edges  + absdiff("Wealth"))

```

---
# Results second hypothesis


```{r lecERGM207bis, echo=TRUE}
flo.wealth1 <- ergm::ergm(flomarriage ~ edges + absdiff("Wealth"))

summary(flo.wealth1)

```

---
# Final Model and Results

## Can we reject the two null Hypotheses? 

```{r lecERGM208, echo=TRUE}
flo.wealth2 <- ergm::ergm(flomarriage ~ edges + nodecov("Wealth") + absdiff("Wealth"))

summary(flo.wealth2)
```

---
# Model Comparison

# Reading Results -significance
<br>
## ERGMs results are interpreted the same way as logistic regressions' results.

## Is it significant?

---
# Reading Results -intensity
<br>
## If the effect is significant, move on checking the intensity. 

## Two options: 

- odds ratios .red[exp(coef)]
- probability .red[I'll give you the formula later :)]

---

# How to use ERGMs

## Multiple hypotheses to test

## Combine endogenous and exogenous terms (always)

## DO NOT FIT ERGM with Exogenous variables only (!!!) - in case it was not clear

## Check the combination of your terms

## Make hypotheses as sharp as possible (in this example either nodecov or absdiff)

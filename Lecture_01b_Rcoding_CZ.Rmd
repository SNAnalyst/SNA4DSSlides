### It is also quite similar to Python in many levels

- if you are a Pythonist you will 'translate' quickly
- you can do in R anything that you usually do in Python

## R has already more packages for statistical analysis
This software choice makes your life easier.

# Have you installed GERGM?

<br> 

## If it did not work in the regular installation, try:

<br>

## `remotes::install_github("matthewjdenny/GERGM", dependencies = TRUE, force = TRUE)`

## If it doesn't work, emails us at `SNA4DS@jads.nl`

(especially mac users)

# `snaverse` suite

<br>

## snaverse - The sna package to rule them all ;-)

<br>

### Written by Roger and Claudia for the SNA4DS class

<br>


### Attempting to make this class more enjoyable :)

## composed of 3 packages

---
# `sna4tutti`

<br> 

## It contains 9 interactive tutorials

<br>

### It makes easier learning SNA4DS since 

- you study the theory 
- immediately get to practice it


---
# `snafun`

<br>

## Doing analysis of dyadic data can be quite challenging

## We introduced a set of function that will make your life much easier

## without `snafun` you would have to navigate at least three packages everyday

- `igraph`
- `sna`
- `network`
- ...
---
# `SNA4DSData`

<br>

It contains the Data tha we will use for...

* Tutorials
* Demostration
* Examples 
* Houseplay
* Class play


... during the semester

You can also use it to practice for the exam

# Opening Tutorials 

<br>

<br>


## `sna4tutti::open_sna4tutti_tutorials()`


## similar to the bootcamp ones


<br>


## Any Problems/Questions?



---
# Solving Possible problems you can encounter
<br>
## The tutorial does not open

### .Red-inline[1) Close R studio] 

### .Red-inline[2) Restart R  studio]

### .Red-inline[3) Try again]

## Still not working? 

### .Red-inline[4) Clear the cache]

## Still not working? 

### .Red-inline[5) Contact us]

---
# Solving Possible problems you can encounter

<br>

## Tutorials have a system to authomatically report errors

In case there is an error, you will see it in two places

- where the error takes place in the tutorial flow

- at the end of the tutorial

## If you see this, copy and paste the error code and email it to us

# Forbidden Items
<br>
- attaching Libraries 

### `library(igraph)` 
<br>

- using the suite of packages tidyverse

### `library(dplyr)`
<br>
<br>
<br>


## DO NOT DO THAT!

---
# JUST DO IT 
<br>
<br>
### prefix packages
### `igraph::degree(net)` OR `stats::lm(Ovar ~ Pred)`

<br>
### do data analysis and manipulation in R base

### `var$col1` OR `Var[,1]`
### etc...

## .red[If you attach libraries and/or use tidyverse we will mark you down]

# Tutorial 01

## Intro to programming in R

### It has been written with two main purposes

- Giving you an overview of the programming skills you need in this class
- Getting you started with them

## It will take you between 1 and 3 hours to complete the tutorial 

## It depends on your programming level and your R level

### It's not difficult!

### Please do it carefully. -- No LLMs cannot code everything for you!

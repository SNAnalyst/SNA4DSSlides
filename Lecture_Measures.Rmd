name: why
description: Why?

# Why all of these definitions and measures?

1. to give you a good understanding of the graph you plan to run analyses on 
(***always*** do your due diligence ***before*** running advanced models!)

1. you need them as part of your analysis of the graph itself

1. because you will need these building blocks extensively for the advanced models 
later in this semester

# Geodesic

The _length of a path_ is the number of edges it goes through.

--

A _geodesic_ from _i_ to _j_ is the **shortest possible** path from _i_ to _j_.

&emsp; .font60[(So, a geodesic and a shorest path are different terms for the same thing. 
We will use both terms interchangeably.)]

--

<br>
The _geodesic length_ is the minimum number of edges needed to move from _i_ to _j_.
This is also called the *distance* from _i_ to _j_.

--

<br>
The *diameter* of the network is the longest distance across all pairs of nodes.

--

<br>
In a **weighted graph**, the shortest path from _i_ to _j_ is the path that has 
the smallest possible sum of weights among all possible paths from _i_ to _j_.

# Geodesic

```{r lecture_measures_15, out.height=460}

Geodesic from 1 to 3?

Geodesic from 1 to 8?

name: weighted
description: weighted networks

### Weighted networks

- In a *weighted* network, the edges are not binary, but have a numeric value.
  + the number of times a webpage links to another specific webpage
  + the average number of times two people talk to each other during the week
  + the $ of economic trade between two countries
  + et cetera

---
name: multiplex
description: multiplex networks

### Multiplex networks

- In a *multiplex* (or *multilevel*) network, there are multiple kinds of edges possible between nodes
  + two people being connected by friendship, trust, coworkership, advice-sharing
  + two countries engaging in economic trade, cultural trade, collaboration in innovation
  + et cetera

# Quantifying node position

There are .Red-inline[.f-marker[.font120[MANY]]]
.Red-inline[.f-marker[.font170[MANY]]]
.Red-inline[.f-marker[.font200[MANY]]] ways to quantify the position of a
node in a network.

Of course, which to choose depends on the research objective.

Let's look at some of the prominent measures.

# Degree

Degree measures a node's _extraversion/outgoingness_ ("outdegree"), _popularity_ ("indegree"), or _involvement_ ("total degree").

total degree = total number of neighbors

# Closeness

__Closeness__ measures how much effort it takes to reach all other nodes in the network.
Sum the distances from *i* to all other vertices, this is  _i_'s _farness_.
Then, invert this sum.

Formally:

$$Closeness(i) = \frac{1}{\sum_{i\neq v}d(v, i)}$$

with _d(v, i)_ equal to the path length between _i_ and _v_.

--
class: course-logo

Closeness is ill-defined when the network is not fully connected 
(b/c there are no paths possible for each dyad). 
Different implementations solve this is different ways and, hence, 
give different results for such networks.

# Stress centrality

_Stress centrality_ measures the amount of ‘work’ or ‘stress’ a vertex has to 
sustain in the network.
A vertex is more central as more shortest paths run through it. 

So: determine all shortest paths between every pair of vertices in the network 
and calculate the number that go through _i_.

--

$$Stress(i) = \sum_{\substack{j\neq i}\\{h\neq i}}^{}\sigma_{hj}(i)$$

where $\sigma_{hj} (i)$ denotes the number of 
shortest paths between *h* and *j* that pass through _i_.

--

In words: _i_'s stress centrality measures how many shortest possible 
routes go through _i_.

name: betweenness
description: Betweenness centrality
class: course-logo

# Betweenness centrality

Betweenness centrality makes stress centrality relative, by taking into account 
how many geodesics exist in the network anyway.

Formally: 

$$Betweenness(i) = \sum_{\substack{i,j}\\{i\neq j}\\{h\neq i}\\{h\neq j}}^{}\frac{\sigma_{hj}(i)}{\sigma_{hj}}$$

where:<br>
&emsp; $\sigma_{hj}$ is the number of geodesics from $h$ to $j$<br>
&emsp; $\sigma_{hj}(i)$ is the number of geodesics from $h$ to $j$ that run through $i$


--

In words: the betweenness centrality of _i_ is the proportion of all shortest 
paths between actors other than _i_ in the graph that pass through _i_. 
Betweenness shows which nodes have information access advantage and are important 
to the network's efficiency. 
It also shows the relative stress on nodes.

# Interpreting centrality scores

_Centrality_ describes specific vertices (or edges), but says nothing about the whole network

- Centrality scores are not/barely comparable between networks, because they depend 
heavily on the specific graph (especially its size and density).

- It is possible to condition on this, but that is beyond today's lecture.

- Centrality scores are most relevant when comparing the scores of vertices within a specific network.

Therefore, we often consider _centrality distributions_.

# centralization calculation

There are two common approaches:

$Centralization = \sum_{i}\left | max(c(w)) -  c(i)\right |$

&emsp; `r chevron_right()` sum of absolute differences between each centrality and the max centrality; this is known as the *freeman* method.


.center.i[or]

$Centralization = sd(c(i))$

&emsp; `r chevron_right()` the standard deviation of the centrality scores of the 
vertices in the graph.

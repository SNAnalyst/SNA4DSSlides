# Q3

<br>
### Open page 73 and insert the terms specified in the example in a series of nested models. The model on page 73 is your final complete model—nest at least 3 of them to explore the effects of the terms one by one.

### 3a) which is the best model? 

### 3b) Can you tell whether each model is dyadic (inter)dependent or independent? 

### 3c) Is each of these variables exogenous or endogenous?

### 3d) Comment on the results. What is the substantive meaning of each of these terms? Are the hypotheses supported? Comment on the odd ratios too. 

### 3e) What is the difference between absdif and nodecov estimated on birthyear?

---
# Q4

## Formulate one additional hypothesis on the network’s structure and then nest another model, adding one variable to explore the network’s structure and test this final hypothesis.

# Markovian effects

<br>
### Effects in a Markov graph 

- It is hypothesized that only neighboring nodes impact <br> the odds of a link

- This level of dependence is also referred to as a <br> nearest-neighbors level of dependence

- or .red[dyadic dependence].

- we need to find all structures that are subject to a <br> Markov (or nearest-neighbor) level of dependence

- Key words: Markovian, structural, dyadic dependent, <br> structure of neighboring nodes

# Terms for shared partners 

### Edgewise shared partners 

- `esp` - undirected
- `desp` - directed (5 options) 1) outgoing two path, 2) incoming two path, 3) reciprocated 2 path 4) outgoing shared partner, 5) incoming shared partner.



### Absence of connections in a structure where these connections would be possible

- `nsp` - undirected edgewise NON-shared partners

- `dnsp` - directed edgewise NON-shared partners.

### Dyadwise shared partners

- `dsp` -  undirected dyadwise shared partner
- `ddsp` - directed dyadwise shared partner

# Exogenous Terms 



---
## Extent to which the attribute values influence edge formation so that <br> it is non-random under that condition. 

<br>
- `nodecov` - undirected - numeric var
- `nodeicov` - directed in - numeric var
- `nodeocov` - directed out - numeric var
<br>

Florentine family example:

The extent to which being wealthier increases the probability of getting married.

.red[same as in a logit model]

---
## The extent to which being in a certain category influences edge formation so that tie formation is non-random under that condition
<br>
- `nodefactor` - undirected - categorical var
- `nodeifactor` - directed in - categorical var
- `nodeofactor` - directed out - categorical var

<br>
.red[same as in a logit model]
---
## Extent to which common features measured in terms of distance similarity influence edge formation, so that edge formation is non-random under that condition. 
<br>
`absdiff` - numeric var
<br>

*Florentine family example:*

The extent to which being equally wealthy increases the probability of getting married.

- poor marry poor
- rich marry rich

This term implicitly attributes a weight to edges since the two connected nodes share the absolute difference

For this reason it is inserted in the model as a matrix rather than as a vector

(even if you don't see this happening)

---
## Extent to which nodes characterized by a specific category belonging to a certain attribute form ties with other node characterized by the same <br> category, so that tie formation under that condition is non-random

<br>

`nodematch` - categorical var

<br>

This term measures .red[homophily]. The probability of a tie due to similarity

- If the coefficient $\theta$ estimated in the model is negative it is measuring heterophily: the probability of a tie due to differences. 

Examples:

- friends in primary school, it is likely that girls are friend with girls (homophily due to sex)
- heterosexual romantic relationships a tie is due to heterophily in sex

---
## Extent to which nodes denoted by different categories of an attribute form <br> ties, so that tie formation under these circumstances is non-random. 
<br>
<br>
`nodemix` - disassortative mixing - categorical var

This term measures .red[heterophily]. The probability of a tie due to dissimilarity

- If the coefficient $\theta$ estimated in the model is negative it is measuring homophily: the probability of a tie due to similarity.

Same example as the previous slide



---
## Extent to which the ties formed in another context influence tie formation in the context of the current model, so that tie formation under that circumstances is non-random. 

<br>
`edgecov` - Matrix attribute. 
<br>

It can be used to insert edge attributes in the model. They need to be specified as a matrix 

E.g., how often two students study together can be inserted in the model as a weighted matrix
<br>
NOTE: using `edgecov` you can run a QAP logistic model using ERGMs!

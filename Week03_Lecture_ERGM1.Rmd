# Goal for today:
<br>
## Introducing Exponential Random Graph models

These models are going to stay with us for a while

yes, they are in the exam

yes, you MUST use them in the project

## Today we cover 

- what the model is (for)
- theory

So that we make sure that you create a solid connection :)

In the following weeks we will touch data, R package, code, so on and so forth

# NETWORKS

### We
    
    observed them 

    conceptualized them

    described them 

    analyzed their parts and components

### STILL

### Are we truly understanding them? 

### Is a description always enough?

## WE CAN DO MORE

---
# Understanding Networks

<br>
### .center[Why is a network the way it is?]
<br>

- Networks conceptualize relationships of many different kinds
- Relationships are not random

    you don't have random friends
    
    you don't marry someone at random
    
    two atoms are not connected at random
    
    streets don't connect random parts of the city
   
### Describing these relationships is not enough. 
### What causes this specific connections? 

---
# Causal Inference for networks
<br>

## Do you remember .red[causal inference]?

You had a class with Claudia in the .red[Bootcamp]! 

### .center[Prediction VS Inference]


## Inference = Deducing 

<br>

### You already know that you can deduce the causes that generated a network

You had a class with Roger in .red[SNA4DS] --- statistical models for networks!

### .center[Inductive VS Deductive]

# Causal inference RECAP


- for IID data (non network)
    
    OLS
    
    T-test
    
    GLM -- Logistic regressions

- for networks 

    NetLogit
    
    MRQAP
    
    LNAM 

Today we add ERGMs to the list

.red[ERGMs are a class of network models for causal inference]

.red[They are a class of models to deduce the cause of an observed relational phenomenon that we observe/conceptualize as a network.]

## Correlation and causation RECAP
<br>
### 2 variables: body weight, gender
<br>
- correlation: body weight & gender (order does not matter)
- causation 
 .center[formula for option 1: body weight ~ gender]
 .center[formula for option 2: gender ~ body weight]

<br>
### Which one makes sense? 

---
name: Causal_inference_recap3
description: Causality explanation of example
# Causal inference RECAP 2b

If 0 is male and 1 is female
## gender ~ body weight

our hypothesis is: 

- If a pregnant woman eats a lot is going to give birth to a girl
<br>
.red[You do realize that this makes no sense, right?]
<br> 
 
## body weight ~ gender

Our model can only test the other hypothesis: 

- Men tend to be bigger than women
<br> 
.red[OBVIOUSLY the only Hypothesis you can test here]


## Causality Matters!

# Explaining network structure
<br>

## ERGMS, as any other statistical model, work with the hypothesis testing (causal) mindset and have:

<br>
### .red[Outcome variable] <- what do we want to explain

### .red[Predictors] <- what we believe could explaining it

<br>
The hypothesis is a sentence that explains how you believe that predictor affects the outcome

We are explaining network structure, right? 

### .red[Our outcome variable MUST be a network]

name: conceptualizing_ergm_outcome_var
description: ergm outcome variable is always a network, it can be seen as a dummy variable
# How do you put a network as an outcome variable?
<br>
## A network describes two things
<br>
### relationship --- edge [1] 

### no relationship  --- no edge [0]

<br>

## Does this sound familiar to you?

# Statistical Mindset RECAP 2.0
<br>

- In  non-network regression models (OLS, GLM, ...) we test whether one or more covariates/predictors predict the outcome variable (coef, p-value).
- This is intended to test whether an hypothesized causal relationships exists 
- Did the predictor(s) affect the outcome? (first: theory; second: math)
- Our p-value is the probability that we can exclude that a certain effect is random 
- Our p-value is NOT a probability of the hypothesis being true, it is the conditional probability of being able to reject the null hypothesis given the data
  - We repeat the experiment 1000 times. 
  - We compare our real data to the 1000 experimental results 
  - If real data = 1000 repetitions it happened by chance
  - If real data != 1000 repetitions we can exclude that what we observe happened by chance in our data.

# Statistical Mindset - Moving on
<br>
### It seems the same thing that we are doing here, right?
<br>
### Can we use a Logistic regression for networks?

# Assumption Violation

<br>
<br>
## Observations must be Independent and Identically Distributed (IID for friends)
<br>
## If you use a non network model your errors estimations will be incorrect!
<br>
...explaining a network takes more work than explaining a regular variable!

# Erdos Renyi Game
<br>

## they introduced the "game" of creating random network given fixed parameters

- N - number of nodes
- E - number of edges (or probability of edge formation)

# A very simple ERGM
<br>
## Looking at the structure of the network

### What is the probability that we observe a network with that specific connections out of all the possible combinations?

In probability terms this is: 

$log P_{ij} (0/1) = λ_{ij}$

Where 

- $P_{ij} (0, 1)$ is the probability of having or not having an edge between each pair of nodes.
- $λ_{ij}$ a parameter that expresses a rate for edge propagation (in our case N of edges)


We compare an observed network against random networks generated with the same parameters.

## Research design
<br>
### General example

RQ: Given the number of nodes in my network, how likely it is that my number of edges is random? 

H1: The number of edges I observe is not random

H0: The number of edges is random

### Specific example

RQ: Given that in this class there are 80 students, how likely it is that they are friends with anyone? 

H1: I observe THIS number of friendships between pairs of students given by the fact that they get along

H0: I observe THIS number of friendships between pairs of students and there is no reason for it

### Consider all the students at JADS as nodes 

## Let's say that JADS organizes an Hackathon with 5K euros at stake 

## You have to form groups to work together every day

### If you study together there is an edge between each pair of you

### I map down the study-together dynamics two days before the Hackathon

Yes. Connections will be different than random, they are driven by a purpose (e.g., everyone wants to connect with good coders etc...)

# Let's use more predictors (P1 model)

Let's do something a little more juicy, shall we? 

### We have a directed network such as Instagram followers. 

You might follow me, but i might not follow you. 

We can observe: 

- senders (followers) A --> B
- receivers (followed) A <-- B
- mutual (followers & receivers together)  A <--> B

P(0, 0) = no edge 

P(1, 0) = send an edge

P(0, 1) = receive an edge 

P(1, 1) = mutual



---
# This model in math [P1 model]
<br>

$log P_{ij} (1/0) = λ_{ij} + α_i + β_j + α_j + β_i + 2θ + ρ_{ij}$

<br>

$λ_{ij}$ probability of the density (N of edges) ER

$α_i$ sender i

$β_j$ receiver j

$α_j$ sender j

$β_i$ receiver i

$2θ + ρ_{ij}$ mutual 

We want to observe these parameters and see whether they are or not random in the network


---
# Expanding our horizons

If we can measure density, sender, receiver, and mutual, 

Why not the rest?

## You know how to measure networks



Dyad Census

Triad Census

...

Are these effects random or are these effect driven by some reason? 


In the ERGM we can estimate the probability of particular descriptive measures that we extract from the network to be non-random (reject the null) 

-- we still don't know the cause, but we can assume it is a good one.

name: Predictors
description: Exogeneous and Endogeneous effects
# Two main Different types of predictors 

<br>
## Exogenous: Outside

## Endogenous: Inside


---
# Endogenous 
<br>
## Effects occurring within the outcome network of interest
<br>
(what happens inside the house in the picture -- inside the network)
<br>
### We already saw

- edge
- sender
- receiver
- mutual 
- ...
- other measures of interest

---
# Exogenous
<br>
## Effects occurring outside of the outcome network 

(like the hurricane)

<br>

### Intuitively, this type of variables correspond to the extra information that is not naturally embedded in the network - They are outside of the network

For example:


If we want to explain the reason why JADS students might play football together using the variable "How much do you like football" 1-5 might already help, right?

# Model Terms or Effects
<br>
## IID linear model (GLM): We can test hypotheses with predictors and controls 

<br>

You get an .red[estimate] and check whether the outcome variable

.red[increases] or .red[decreases]

When predictor/control variates

These predictors/controls are always information about something

## You already saw that, but with ERGMs we can be more flexible. 

## .red[We can customize model terms as much as we like! including both information (exogenous) and network structure (endogenous)]

# Recap

Outcome variable: Always a .red[Network]

Predictors: Exogenous and Endogenous 

Effects: for both kind of predictors, several effects to look at

Prediction: Linear Model

Specification: Theory driven (Research question, hypothesis testing)

How it works: 

- We specify a model that we believe generates the synthetic reality we care for

- The model expresses a probability distribution that generate networks that behave as the observed one

- We compare real data to the generated data 

- We can make some conclusions on what caused the relationships observed in the network (test the hypothesis)

How does this run? We will talk about the algorithm to estimate these models in the following lessons.

# Data
<br>
We collected network data in a school since we are interested in understanding the dynamics of friendship.
<br>
We have three nodal attributes

- their gender
- their age
- who is a smoker

# Questions and Hypothesis 
<br>
## (thinking in regressions mindset -- causal mindset)
<br>
RQ: What are the drivers of friendship in this school?
<br>
After doing some research we believe that young people are 


- more likely to make friends with people of the same gender
- more likely to make friends with people closer to their age
- smokers are more likely to be friends with other smokers

# Questions and Hypothesis (thinking ergm)

<br>

We know that friendship in a school does not have homogeneous patterns (== to random)

- There are some people that are more popular than others 
- There are some people that are more social than others

# Endogenous effects 
<br>
- There are some people that are more popular than others

.red[POPULARITY] -- preferential attachment (Barabasi and Albert)

Receiving ties

Receiving ties

.red[SOCIALITY]

Sending ties

# Model specification
<br>
After we did this research design we would know what to insert in our model 

In PROTO-CODE, the model would be something like that

<br>

school ~ .red[HOMOPHILY] (Gender) + .red[ABSOLUTE DIFFERENCE] (Age) + .red[HOMOPHILY] (Smokers) + .red[POPULARITY] + .red[SOCIALITY]

<br>

For this round I leave the math to you since this starts to be quite long :)

# Example 1 
<br>
## You want to show passages in a network of football players.

### Since the football court is green you decide it would be impactful to use the color green for the edges (passages).

# d. Fancy versus functional
<br>
<br>
## You want to insert too much information in a very elaborated way
   
- many colors
- weird node shapes
- labels on the nodes and edges
- ...
    
## Networks are a bit too powerful for their (your) own good.

### Load the network “UKfaculty”

### 81 nodes

### 817 edges

### 1 nodes attribute (school affiliation)

### 1 edge attribute (how often they are in contact)

---
# Very simple story

<br>
### There are people working in a university and they are organized in three groups. 
[same as JADS: we have three units]

## Story/Goal

### You want to be able to show the pattern of contacts within groups and accross groups

---
# Plot 1 Instruction
<br>

### make a visualization using 

* one edge attribute

* one node attribute


### that are able to tell what is happening in this network. 

### Decide what is the best way to represent this story first and plot after.

.scroll-box-18[
```{r viz 01, echo=TRUE}

# # Generate colors based on how often they hang out:
# colrs <- c("cadetblue", "dodgerblue", "dodgerblue3", "blue", "darkblue" )
# # create a new attribute with the color
# igraph::V(net)$color <- colrs[igraph::V(net)$Hang.Out] # we attribute each category to a colour
# 
# plot(net,
#      edge.arrow.size = .2, 
#      edge.color = "gray80",
#      vertex.frame.color = "#ffffff",#node perimeter
#      vertex.label = igraph::V(net)$gender, 
#      vertex.label.cex = 0.6,  # vertex label size

The scale is not relevant (it is always re-scaled to fit a -1 to 1 plotting area. 

You can get this layout before plotting by just calling the layout function on the graph:

```{r layout_options02, echo=TRUE}

l <- igraph::layout_on_grid(UKfaculty)

# 4. Final Remarks

# Your Book
<br>
### ... is plotting using `network` 

### that code won't work with `igraph` objects. 
<br>

### Still, the logic is very similar

### `snafun::to_igraph` & `snafun::plot` 

### OR you can always use `intergraph` and plot in `igraph`

### OR look up the corresponding paramenters and plot in `network`

### vertex:

- `vertex.color`
- `vertex.label`
- `vertex.size`
- `vertex.frame.color`

### edge:
- `edge.arrow.size`
- `edge.color`
- `edge.width`

### overall:  `layout`

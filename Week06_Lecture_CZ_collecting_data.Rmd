## .red[The number of friends. ]
### Is 3 a good number? 

## .red[What is a friend?]
### Are these questions capturing 'friendship'? Is a colleague a friend?

"To what extent do you consider this person your friend compared to your friends outside uni?"
it could mean too many things

Maybe this is fine, but we need to make sure to define what we are measuring before

description: how to make an unbiased study design

# Unbiased design
## .red[Think carefully]

### - Define your target relationship
### - Decide what is the right number of connections per respondent to collect
### - Make sure your research design is linked to the research question
### - Ask the questions in a specific way 
- make sure you do not ask two questions in one. 

### - Make sure that you end up with measurable answers 

- preferably use Likert scales with odd numbers of points (3, 5, 7, 11)

## .red[Remember: A fully unbiased study does not exist!]

description: Decide on the right approach for your sample

# Sampling 
## - Do you have access to the entire population?
### yes? Run a survey like the one we used 

- targeted a group with a boundary (SNA4DS students)
- Not everyone responded, but this is simply .red[missing data]


### No? You need to use an egonet approach
You ask them to provide the name of their relationship since you might not even know how many are they

### entire sample: Roster with names
### egonet: "snowballing" data

# Sofware

For running a survey you can use regular platforms not specifically meant for 
networks (Qualtrics, Survey Monkey etc...)

But there are software specifically designed to collect network data. For instance .red[Network Canvas]

ego or entire sample

# 3) Discuss how do you process newly collected data 

---
# How do you process newly collected data?
<br>
## Your data looks like this (you want your data to look like this):
```{r L4_6, echo = FALSE}

survey <- data.frame(respondent = c('Anna', 'Ben', 'Cleo'),
                     alter1 = c('David', 'NA', 'Anna'),
                     alter2 = c('Luke', 'NA', 'David') ,
                     gender = c("F", "M", "O"), 
                     cinemaW1 = c(1, NA, 2),
                     cinemaW2 =c(0, NA, 2))

```


```{r L4_7, echo = TRUE}
survey
```

## To analyse it as a network we need to process it 

### Let's explore one way to do it

---
# Creating an edge list

### Let's do the process manually first 

- match: respondent -- alter 1

- match: respondent -- alter 2

- append them

```{r L4_8, echo = TRUE}
(EdgeList <- data.frame(rbind(cbind(survey$respondent, survey$alter1), 
                              cbind(survey$respondent, survey$alter2))))
```

## If you have many columns this could get nasty. Better to loop 

---
# Edge List via for loop

```{r L4_9, echo = TRUE}

col <- survey[ , 1:3] #<- select the columns respondent, alter1, alter2

EdgeList <- data.frame()
temp <- data.frame()

for (i in 2:ncol(col)) {
  temp <- cbind(col[, 1], col[, i])
  EdgeList <- rbind(EdgeList, temp)
}

EdgeList
```

### Are we done? We are definitely not. An edge list does not consider isolates. 

---
# Make a node list 

### Let's do the process manually: We need to make sure that all the nodes are included, but one time only


```{r L4_10, echo = TRUE}

(NodeList <- unique(c(survey$respondent, survey$alter1, survey$alter2)))

```



```{r L4_20, echo = FALSE}
NodeList[5] <- NA
```



```{r L4_210, echo = TRUE}

NodeList <- na.omit(NodeList) # always remove NAs

```

Unless we use also a node list, Ben would disappear from the sample

.red[A for loop would make your life better in this case too]

---
# So, now what?
<br>
## Now we turn it into a network
```{r L4_11, echo = FALSE}
EdgeList[2, 2] <- NA
EdgeList[5, 2] <- NA
```


```{r L4_12, echo = TRUE}

EdgeList <- na.omit(EdgeList)
surveynet <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(EdgeList, NodeList, directed = TRUE)


```

<br>
### Disclaimer: there are many other ways, but this is a very useful one
<br>
### Still, explore the functions in `igraph` and `network` for creating networks
---
# Result

```{r L4_13, echo = TRUE, fig.height=2.5}


plot(surveynet)

```

And the attributes? Edge attributes are processed the same way as the edge list, while node attributes needs to be processed as vectors (consider that you will have missing data for the alters)

# To spead up the process

```{r L4_14, echo = FALSE}
survey[2,2] <- NA
survey[2,3] <- NA
survey[2,5] <- NA
survey[2,6] <- NA

```

.scroll-box-18[
```{r L4_15, echo = TRUE}

# select columns with network info as df
net <- data.frame(survey[,1:3])

# select columns with edge attributes as df
eAttr <- data.frame(cbind(survey$cinemaW1, survey$cinemaW2))

# prepare a vector with node attribute
nAttr <- survey$gender

# Make the edge list
EdgeList <- snafun::make_edgelist(net, eAttr)
EdgeList <- na.omit(EdgeList)

# Make the node list 
NodeList <- snafun::make_nodelist(net, nAttr)

# turn it into a network
surveynet <- igraph::graph_from_data_frame(EdgeList, NodeList, directed = TRUE)
surveynet
